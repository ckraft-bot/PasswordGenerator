# PasswordGenerator
This a password generator. Now you can (nearly) bullet proof your accounts by using this password generator because the password creations are randomzied. Most people will create passwords that are reflective of their personal infomartion (birthdays, names, pet's names, etc). Having personal infomation in your password leaves you vulnerable. Despite how much easier it is to memorize the perosnal passwords, it's more prudent to go with something unbiased to you. But coming up with random passwords is not easy so allow this genrator to take that stress off of you. Humans, on average, can hold 7+/- 2 "bits" of information in the short term memory which can be easily exectued in the paswword gernator. You can specify the length of password you'd like to have. The algorithm will create your specified lenth paswword via permutations made up of alphabets, symbols, and numerals. Now that the password generator has taken the dauting task of creating a randomized password for you, your job is to simply commit that password to memory.
